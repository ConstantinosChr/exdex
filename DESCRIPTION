Description: Performs frequentist inference for the extremal index using the 
    methodologies described in Suveges and Davison (2010)  <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292> 
    and in Northrop (2015) <doi:10.1007/s10687-015-0221-5>. This is done in two 
    ways, based on the two main forms of extreme value theory. One uses threshold
    inter-exceedance times based on the K-gaps model and the other one is based 
    on block maxima.
